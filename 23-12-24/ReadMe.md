# JavaScript Assignments (Dec 23)

This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to **String Methods**, **Arrays**, and **Objects** in JavaScript. All tasks have been solved manually without using built-in functions, providing an in-depth understanding of the core concepts.

## Tasks on String Methods

1. **Convert to Uppercase and Lowercase**  
   Manually convert a sentence to uppercase and lowercase by iterating through each character and changing its case.

2. **Count the Total Characters**  
   Manually count the total number of characters in a sentence (including spaces) by looping through the string.

3. **Count Occurrences of a Character**  
   Count how many times a specific character (e.g., 'a') appears in the string by iterating through each character and checking for matches.

4. **Extract First and Last Word**  
   Extract the first and last word from a sentence manually by splitting the sentence into words and accessing the first and last elements.

5. **Remove Spaces from a String**  
   Remove all spaces from a string by iterating through each character and excluding spaces from the new string.

6. **Check if String Starts/Ends with Specific Word**  
   Check if a string starts with a specific word (e.g., "Hello") or ends with a specific word (e.g., "World") by comparing the first and last words manually.

7. **Split Sentence into Words**  
   Manually split a sentence into an array of words by iterating through the sentence and adding words to an array based on spaces.

8. **Replace Word in Sentence**  
   Manually replace all instances of a specific word (e.g., "good") with another word (e.g., "excellent") by iterating through the sentence and replacing matching words.

## Tasks on Arrays

1. **Manipulate Array of Numbers**  
   Manually add a number to the end of an array, remove the first number, and display the updated array by directly manipulating the array elements.

2. **Sort Array of Strings**  
   Manually sort an array of strings alphabetically by comparing each pair of elements and swapping them if necessary (using Bubble Sort).

3. **Remove Duplicates from an Array**  
   Manually remove duplicate numbers from an array by checking each element against others and only keeping unique values.

4. **Find Largest and Smallest Number**  
   Manually find the largest and smallest number in an array by looping through the array and comparing each element.

5. **Reverse an Array**  
   Manually reverse an array by swapping elements without using built-in functions.

6. **Combine Two Arrays**  
   Combine two arrays of equal length into one array by manually alternating elements from each array.

## Tasks on Objects

1. **Create and Display Student Object**  
   Create an object representing a student with properties like `name`, `age`, and `class` and display them.

2. **Add New Property to Object**  
   Manually add a new property (e.g., "grade") to the student object and display it.

3. **Modify Car Object**  
   Create an object for a car with properties like `make`, `model`, `year`, and `color`, and modify one property manually.

4. **Multiple Objects in an Array**  
   Create multiple objects (e.g., students) and store them in an array, displaying the details of each object.

## Comprehensive Task: Mini-Database

1. **Add, Update, and Delete Objects**  
   Create a mini-database of 3 objects (e.g., students or books), manually add a new object, update a property, delete an object, and display the updated list.

Each task has been completed manually, providing a deeper understanding of how JavaScript works at a fundamental level without relying on built-in functions. I Feel Amazing to explore the solutions to gain a better grasp of string manipulation, array handling, and object management in JavaScript.
